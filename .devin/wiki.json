Documentation should prioritize library users (developers building bots), focusing on installation, basic usage, and the public API. All user-facing guides must be kept simple and follow a reference style. Avoid deep technical dives in getting started guides. Complex internal workflows (e.g., Initialization Flow, Playback Workflow) MUST be documented ONLY in the \"Internal Architecture\" section, not in user guides.",
